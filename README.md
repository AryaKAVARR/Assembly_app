# Assembly_app

This was my third semester capstone project. To do this, we must set up an assembly line where customers' orders are handled in accordance with their specifications. Core concepts are used to construct the complete project. Each class has its own work to do in order to complete the assignment. Additionally, I haven't created a single manual loop; rather, algorithms are employed to create all of the loops. I utilised containers to store client data since they are simple to grow and provide capabilities that help the work get done more efficiently.
